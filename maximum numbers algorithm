Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables n1, n2, n3
Step 3: If n1 is greater than n2,
        If n1 is greater than n3,
            Display "n1 is Maximum"
        Else
            Display "n3 is Maximum"
    Else
        If n2 is greater than n3,
            Display "n2 is Maximum"
        Else
            Display "n3 is Maximum"
Step 4: Stop
